# Basic usage

FrameTuber is pretty easy to setup and use, but a few hints can help it run smoothly.

First, make sure you your frames are setup to be the same size.  By ensuring they match, you reduce the chance they won't match up.

Second, you'll need to upload your frames to someplace that can be accessed without logging in.  Places like Imgur work well, but so does a discord private message.  They don't have to be searchable, just accessable using a URL.  Make sure you're using the raw link.  It will usually end in PNG or JPEG.

Third, make sure you're using a static image for each frame. GIFs don't work well (yet).  If you need animation, hang tight, we're working on it.

Fourth, using the FrameTuber renderer in a browser source ensures it shows up with transparency.  But it can cause black text to render over a dark grey background.  If you're having trouble getting the linking code, put a Color source behind it temporarly to read the code.

Fifth, if you have everything set up the way you want, and the renderers you wanna use connected, hit Save Settings.  This will lock in the renderers, and store the frame urls you're using.  This means you won't need to reconnecte using the linking codes the next time you launch FrameTuber.

Finally, if everything is going wrong and you need to start from scratch, hit Reset Settings.  You'll need to tell the renderers to forget their old associations too, but this will get you back to a fresh start.
