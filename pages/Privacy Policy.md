# Privacy Policy

Gonna keep this simple and to the point:

- We ask for a Username.  This identifies you on this site.
- We store your Patreon Info and link it to your Username.  This is to track if you have paid or not.
- We store your Twitch Info and link it to your Username. This is to allow commands to be sent from Twitch chat.
- We store your Discord Info and link it to your Username.  This is to allow tracking the voice activity for the animation features of FrameTuber.
- We create and store a secret identifer and link it to your Username. This is to allow the FrameTuber desktop service to connect and use the information from the service.
- We create and store cookie identifiers and link them to your Username. This allows you to remain logged in on the site.
- We store your IP address. This is not linked to any information, and is only used to limit excessive signup attempts.
- You can request all the info attached to your account to be removed. This will necessitate removing "all" the info, and as such you will not be able to continue using the service under that account.  IP addresses are not connected to any account info, and will be purged after 90 days.


There, now you know what we store, and why.  If we do need to change this, you'll be messaged through Patreon.  And again, you can ask for this info to be deleted, and we *will* delete it.  But when it's gone, that's it.  No backups, nothing.
