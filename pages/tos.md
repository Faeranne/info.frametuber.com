# Terms of Service

Ok, this is important.  I'm not gonna do a bunch of legal mumbo jumbo, cause I'm not a lawyer, and I'm like 97% certain this stuff won't be legally inforcable.

So here's the deal.  The software that powers the important parts of this service is open-source.  You can use the software however you want, as long as you don't pretend to be me.  Plain and simple.

For the site itself, use it as intended.  If you try to break it, or use it for other purposes than powering the FrameTuber software, you're gonna get kicked off of it.  The site uses Patreon to cover costs, and will check your Patreon pledge to allow things to keep running.  You can only connect one discord and twitch account to your account on this serivce at a time.

You are allowed multiple accounts, but each must have a seperate Patreon Payment, so you need to follow their ToS.

This is my personal account and work, and will remove accounts at my own discression.  If I do, I will make sure to message you on Patreon, so you can decide to terminate or change your pledge as you see fit.

Patreon Pledges are *not* a payment for service, services are offered as a bonus to the pleges.

If I remove you're account, this does not mean you have to stop using the FrameTuber desktop software.  While I regulate what people I'm willing to support on the service, I can't, and won't, try to limit who uses the desktop tools, or the source for the web version.
